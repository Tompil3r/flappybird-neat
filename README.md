# FlappyBird-NEAT
NEAT algorithm trained to play the game Flappy Bird!

This repository hosts the experimentation of my own [neat library](https://github.com/Tompil3r/neat) on the game Flappy Bird.
In this repository you will find the implementation of the Flappy Bird game, the code to train and the test the genomes on it,
and a file containing the best genome from my training, which accrording to my testing can play the game infinitely without dying!
